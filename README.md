#iDoIt

## The journey

This is my attempt at the todo list project on The Odin Project. What I intended to be a weekend project turned out to be a whole two week shebang. I continued making this website using vanilla javascript with a few packages to help me along. I attempted to decouple my code with PubSub, which worked great but I think I need to use better strategies with that pattern. At the last minute I used Luxon for dates which greatly eased the use of dates with javascript as the Date object in javascript is pure chaos. I used webpack once more to assemble all my scripts, images, and files together in one package, works great.

What's interesting about this project is it was long enough and geniunely challenging enough where I not only learnt a lot of javascript on the way but you can see how I change as a javascript writer. I didn't really find a consistent style with my javascript, which I hope to pick up while writing and reading more javascript. I also had to do several rewrites of modules because I'm figuring out what works and what doesn't. And why did I start using the class declaration in the beginning then disregard it for factories and IIFEs, who knows!

## What it does

It's simple, you can create new lists, add tasks to the list, complete tasks, edit tasks, and just about everything you can think of except for saving the session. I might return to this at a later date and implement saving, but at this point I'm done with it.
